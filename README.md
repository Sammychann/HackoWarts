Ganga Water Monitoring and Analysis Dashboard
Oct 2024 - Oct 2024

The Ganga Water Monitoring and Analysis Dashboard leverages multiple visuals to effectively communicate the health of the Ganga River ecosystem. The first dashboard includes KPI cards and gauge visuals to display key water quality metrics, such as pH levels, dissolved oxygen, and turbidity. A stacked bar chart illustrates the variations in water quality across different monitoring stations over time, while a line chart tracks the seasonal fluctuations of pollutants in the water.
The dashboard features slicers and date filters to allow interactive filtering based on location, time period, and specific pollutants, providing a dynamic view of the riverâ€™s health and enabling in-depth analysis of water quality trends.
